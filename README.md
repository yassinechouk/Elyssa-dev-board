## Getting started (Arduino IDE)

### 1. Install the board package

1. Install [Arduino IDE 2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Open **File → Preferences** and paste this URL in **Additional boards manager URLs**:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yassinechouk/Elyssa-dev-board/main/elyssa-arduino/package_moovma_elyssa_index.json
   ```

3. Open **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**, search **Moovma**, and click **Install** (the package contains the Elyssa board).

**Linux / macOS:** install Python 3.

### 2. Connect the board

1. Plug the board in with a USB-C **data** cable.
2. Select **Tools → Board → Moovma → Elyssa**.
3. Select **Tools → Port →** the port labelled **Elyssa**.

Keep the other **Tools** options at their default values.

### 3. Upload your first sketch

1. Open **File → Examples → 01.Basics → Blink**.
2. Click **Upload**. The on-board LED starts blinking.

### If the upload fails

Put the board in download mode manually: **hold BOOT, press and release RESET, then release BOOT**.
Select the port that appears and click **Upload** again. This is usually needed only once.

### Serial Monitor

Open **Tools → Serial Monitor**. Press **RESET** to see the first messages.

### Compile times

The **first** compile of a new sketch is the slowest (about 40 to 90 s on our Windows test PC, longer with big libraries such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth). Compiling the **same sketch again** takes about 7 to 9 s. The first compile after installing a new version of the package also rebuilds the ESP32 core once (1 to 4 minutes). See [TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md](TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md#compile-times) to speed it up.

## Pinout

Names follow the **silkscreen** of the board. All of them are available in sketches without any `#include`.

| Function | Names in sketches | GPIO | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header IO0 to IO6 | `IO0` ... `IO6`, `A0` ... `A6`, `T0` ... `T6` | 1 to 7 | analog (ADC1, works with Wi-Fi on), touch, digital |
| I2C (header + Qwiic) | `SDA`, `SCL` (`A8`/`A9`, `T8`/`T9`) | 8, 9 | 4.7 kΩ pull-ups on the board |
| UART (header) | `TX`, `RX` | 43, 44 | |
| SPI (header) | `SS` (`CS`), `MOSI`, `SCK` (`CLK`), `MISO` | 34, 35, 36, 37 | default `SPI` bus |
| microSD (separate SPI bus) | `SD_CS`, `SD_MOSI`, `SD_SCK`, `SD_MISO` | 10, 11, 12, 13 | |
| PWM | `PWM1`, `PWM2`, `PWM3` | 14, 47, 48 | `PWM1` is also touch pin `T10` |
| RGB LED | `LED_RED`, `LED_GREEN` (`LED_BUILTIN`), `LED_BLUE` | 39, 38, 33 | active high |
| BOOT button | `BOOT_BUTTON` | 0 | LOW when pressed |
| Battery voltage | `BAT_SENSE` | 7 | same pin as `IO6`; only if solder jumper **JP3** is bridged |
| IMU (internal I2C bus) | `SDA_gyro`, `SCL_gyro`, `INT_gyro` | 17, 18, 21 | address 0x6A, `Wire1` uses these pins |

There is no `A7` and no `T7`. The internal flash pins are not exposed.

### Small examples

```cpp
Serial.println(touchRead(T10));                 // touch: T0..T6, T8, T9, T10
Serial.println(analogRead(A0));                 // analog: 0..4095
Serial.println(analogReadMilliVolts(A1));       // analog, calibrated, in mV
analogWrite(PWM1, 128);                         // PWM: 50 % duty
if (digitalRead(BOOT_BUTTON) == LOW) { }        // BOOT button
```

I2C (header or Qwiic):

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
Wire.begin();                                   // SDA = GPIO8, SCL = GPIO9
```

microSD (own SPI bus, not the one on the header):

```cpp
#include <SPI.h>
#include <SD.h>
SPIClass sdSPI(HSPI);
sdSPI.begin(SD_SCK, SD_MISO, SD_MOSI, SD_CS);
SD.begin(SD_CS, sdSPI);
```

Battery voltage (only with **JP3** bridged; do not use `IO6` for anything else then):

```cpp
float vbat = analogReadMilliVolts(BAT_SENSE) * 2 / 1000.0;   // BAT_SENSE = VBAT / 2
```

The battery charger has no GPIO: its CHG output only drives the red charge LED.

---

## RGB LED

Built into the board package: no `#include` needed.

```cpp
setLedColor(ELYSSA_GREEN);     // ELYSSA_OFF, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE
setLedRGB(255, 80, 0);         // any mix, 0..255 per channel
```

| Channel | Pin |
|---|---|
| Red | `LED_RED` = GPIO39 |
| Green | `LED_GREEN` = GPIO38 (`LED_BUILTIN`, so Blink works) |
| Blue | `LED_BLUE` = GPIO33 |

The LED is off when a sketch starts. It lights up red while a sketch is being uploaded: this is normal (see [TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md](TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md#red-during-upload)).

---

## Motion sensor (IMU)

The board has an STMicroelectronics LSM6DS3TR-C: accelerometer (in g) and gyroscope (in degrees per second). The basic functions are built into the board package, with no `#include`:

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  if (!elyssa_imu_begin()) Serial.println("IMU not found");
  elyssa_imu_enable_tap();
}

void loop() {
  float x, y, z;
  elyssa_imu_read_accel(x, y, z);
  Serial.printf("x %.2f  y %.2f  z %.2f g\n", x, y, z);
  if (elyssa_imu_tapped()) setLedColor(ELYSSA_GREEN);
  delay(10);
}
```

Basic functions: reading (acceleration, rotation, temperature), ranges, sample rate, low power, pitch / roll / orientation, gyroscope calibration, tap and double tap, free-fall, motion, step counter, wake-up from deep sleep by motion.

Advanced functions (recording, filters, self-test, accelerometer calibration, stillness, tilt, wrist tilt, significant motion, interrupt pin...) are in the **ElyssaIMU** library, also included in the board package: add `#include <ElyssaIMU.h>`.

Examples: **File → Examples → ElyssaIMU** (Basics and Advanced). Full reference: [ElyssaIMU README](platform/libraries/ElyssaIMU/README.md). Known limitations: [TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md](TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

The IMU is read over I2C at 400 kHz. Live reading with `elyssa_imu_ready()` keeps up with every sample up to 833 Hz; above that, use the recording (FIFO) functions of the ElyssaIMU library.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Moovma** is not in the Boards Manager | Check the URL in **File → Preferences**. If it was added recently, close the IDE and delete `package_moovma_elyssa_index.json` from the `Arduino15` folder (Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arduino15`), then reopen the IDE. |
| Upload fails or the port disappears | Download mode by hand: hold **BOOT**, press **RESET**, release **BOOT**, select the new port, upload again. Use a USB-C **data** cable. |
| The Serial Monitor stays empty | Press **RESET**. Keep **USB CDC On Boot = Enabled**. Open the monitor at the baud rate of `Serial.begin()`. |
| The red LED is on during an upload | Normal, see [TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md](TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md#red-during-upload). |
| `multiple definition of lsm6ds3tr_c_...` | Another installed library contains ST's LSM6DS3TR-C driver. Remove it: the board package already includes it. |
| The IMU is not found, or `Wire1` and the IMU conflict | Call `Wire1.begin(SDA1, SCL1, 400000)` **before** `elyssa_imu_begin()`. |
| `T10` and `PWM1` do not work together | They are the same pin (GPIO14): use it for touch **or** for PWM. |
| The first compile is very slow | Normal for a new sketch. See [Compile times](TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md#compile-times). |
| "Invalid FQBN" after an update | Select the board again in **Tools → Board → Moovma → Elyssa**. |

## What has been tested

Tested on Elyssa v5:

- Upload in both USB modes, Blink, Serial Monitor
- RGB LED (all colours and `setLedRGB()`)
- IMU: reading, angles, orientation, tap, double tap, free-fall, motion, steps, wake-up from deep sleep (61 of 61 checks)
- ElyssaIMU library: 90 of 93 checks (the 3 failures are the wrist-tilt issue listed in [TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md](TIPS_AND_KNOWN_ISSUES.md))
- Touch on `IO0` to `IO5` and `T10`, BOOT button
- Pin constants of `pins_arduino.h` (self-test)

Not tested on a board yet: microSD with a card, battery charging and `BAT_SENSE`, external I2C devices (header and Qwiic), the `PWM2` / `PWM3` pins against the silkscreen, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE applications, deep-sleep current.
